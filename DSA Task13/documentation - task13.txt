🔹 1) Lists

What: Used to store student grades and adjusted results.

Example:

scores = [73, 67, 38, 33]
print(scores[0])  # 73

🔹 2) Iteration with for

What: Process each grade one by one.

Example:

for grade in [50, 60, 70]:
    print(grade + 5)

🔹 3) Conditionals (if)

What: Apply rules like “only round if grade >= 38.”

Example:

x = 45
if x >= 40:
    print("Pass")
else:
    print("Fail")

🔹 4) Modulo Operator %

What: Helps check remainder when dividing by 5 to find next multiple of 5.

Example:

num = 47
print(num % 5)  # 2 (remainder when dividing by 5)

🔹 5) List Building

What: Append results to a new list while processing input.

Example:

new_scores = []
for s in [10, 20, 30]:
    new_scores.append(s + 1)
print(new_scores)  # [11, 21, 31]
