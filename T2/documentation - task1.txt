ðŸ”¹ 1) Loops (for, while)

What: Used to iterate over elements in a sequence like lists, strings, or ranges.

Example:

arr = [1, 2, 3]
for i in range(len(arr)):
    print(arr[i])

ðŸ”¹ 2) range() Function

What: Generates a sequence of numbers, often used for looping with indices.

Example:

for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

ðŸ”¹ 3) Conditional Statements (if)

What: Allow checking conditions and executing code accordingly.

Example:

x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("Greater than 5")

ðŸ”¹ 4) Tuples

What: Immutable sequences, often used to group related values together.

Example:

pair = (2, 4)
print(pair[0], pair[1])  # 2, 4

ðŸ”¹ 5) List Operations

What: Lists support dynamic storage and operations like append(), iteration, and nested loops.

Example:

items = []
items.append(42)
print(items)  # [42]

ðŸ”¹ 6) Sets / Dictionaries (Optional for efficiency)

What:

Sets store unique elements and support fast membership testing.

Dictionaries map keys to values.


Example (Set):

seen = set()
seen.add(5)
print(5 in seen)  # True


Example (Dictionary):

counts = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
print(counts["a"])  # 1
