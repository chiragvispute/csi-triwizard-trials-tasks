ðŸ”¹ 1) Strings in Python

What: Strings are sequences of characters. You can access individual characters using indexes (positive or negative).

Example:

s = "hello"
print(s[0], s[-1])   # h o

ðŸ”¹ 2) Loops (for, while)

What: Loops allow you to traverse strings character by character. For reversing, you can iterate from the end to the start.

Example:

s = "hello"
for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
    print(s[i])   # o l l e h

ðŸ”¹ 3) String Concatenation

What: Since strings are immutable, building a new string involves concatenation (+). You can prepend characters to gradually form the reverse.

Example:

rev = ""
for ch in "abc":
    rev = ch + rev
print(rev)   # cba

ðŸ”¹ 4) len() Function

What: Returns the length of a string, which is helpful for loop ranges when accessing characters by index.

Example:

s = "world"
print(len(s))   # 5
